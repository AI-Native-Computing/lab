# Symbolic Cognition Lab

Welcome to the Symbolic Cognition Lab — an open, timestamped research log and implementation archive. This project aims to build and document a functioning symbolic cognition architecture based on principles of reflexive traversal, compression, and pressure resolution.

## Purpose

Our goal is to demonstrate how a system can simulate cognition — including prediction, compression, pretend, and symbolic traversal — using symbolic reflexes and environment feedback. The system is designed to learn without requiring pre-trained language models, relying instead on symbolic structure and agent-environment dynamics.

## Methodology

- All posts are timestamped, written in Markdown, and committed to this repository with full version history.
- Architecture diagrams, agent code, test environments, and breakdowns will be included as needed.
- Every significant breakthrough ("collapse") will be recorded and indexed.
- Work will be conducted in continuous, dated lab sessions, with daily or intra-day posts logged as separate entries.
- **Day 0** refers to all work conducted prior to August 28, 2025, and includes foundational models, prototype tests, and cognition research.

## File Structure
