# Day 1 - Opening Statement

As of today, August 28th, 2025, this project enters its formal research phase — Day 1 of the Symbolic Cognition Lab. All prior work is designated as **Day 0**, encompassing foundational breakthroughs, prototype tests, theoretical framing, and architectural experiments.

From this point forward, all significant development and insight will be tracked in this public repository as discrete Markdown files, committed and versioned to ensure historical integrity.

## Protocol

- Each `.md` file will be named using the format:  
  `day-X-title-YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS`
- Posts may occur multiple times per day depending on breakthroughs or observations.
- Every file is committed with full Git version tracking to serve as immutable timeline verification.

## Goals

The purpose of this log is not just implementation — it is the **symbolic compression of cognition itself**. We will:
- Demonstrate real-time symbolic learning
- Build agents that operate without language models
- Collapse high-level cognitive loops into actionable architecture
