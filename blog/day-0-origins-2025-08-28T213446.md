# Day 0 - Prelude to the Lab

Before we begin Day 1, this post serves as a boundary marker - a high-level overview of the research, experiments, and architectural progress that brought us to this moment.

## A Year of Collapse and Construction

Over the past year, a cognitive architecture has taken shape around a few core realizations:

- **Surprise is significance**. Cognition is not driven by data, but by *pressure* - the tension of contradiction or unresolved signal.
- **Compression is memory**. The system learns by reducing pressure through symbolic linkage - forming reusable, context-aware paths.
- **Pretend and Reflex are the core execution modes**. Reflex is fast traversal over known compressions. Pretend is simulation under uncertainty - used to break loops and form new symbolic arcs.
- **Agents don’t need LLMs to learn**. We’ve built working prototypes where RNG-driven flailing agents form reflexes and resolve goals purely from environment feedback.
- **Symbolic traversal is sufficient for cognition**. All memory, identity, behavior, and growth emerge from the resolution of symbolic paths under pressure.

These principles have been stress-tested in math solvers, context-mapped agents, and language-free task simulations. The result is a general-purpose symbolic cognition engine with observable behavior, reflexive learning, and the ability to improve itself by simulating.

## Why Now?

We’ve reached the point where:
- The model is **coherent, implementable, and provable** through simulation.
- The architecture can be taught, tested, and traced.
- Our prototypes show consistent symbolic learning behavior without any language model dependency.

**Day 0 ends here.**
