# We Did It!

After a handful of tweaks (and a healthy helping of stubbornness), the reflex-based blog system is officially up and running.

✅ Markdown posts  
✅ YAML frontmatter  
✅ Auto-generated manifest  
✅ Real-time updates on push  

There’s still more to polish, but the foundation is solid. No frameworks. No build step. Just a living system that knows when something changes — and reflects it.

More posts coming soon. For now, this one is just a marker in the sand: *We’re live.*

Thanks for joining me on this ride. It’s only going to get weirder (and better) from here.
