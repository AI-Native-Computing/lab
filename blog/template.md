# 🧪 Demo Post For Fun

Hey there, fellow human (or curious AI)! 👋  
This post exists *purely* to demo what your blog can do with good ol' Markdown.  
If you’re reading this, your static site is probably working — which is reason enough to celebrate.  `Yay!`

---

## ✍️ What You'll See Below

- ✅ Headers (from `#` to `######`)
- ✅ Lists (ordered and unordered)
- ✅ Inline and block `code`
- ✅ Tables
- ✅ Quotes
- ✅ Images
- ✅ Links (both internal and external)
- ✅ Horizontal rules
- ✅ Bold, _italic_, and ~strikethrough~

---

## 🗂 Example Sections

### H2 Heading  
You can use **multiple heading levels** for structure.

#### H4 Subheading  
These are great for breaking down thoughts within thoughts.

---

## 🔢 Ordered List Example

1. Initialize your blog.
2. Drop a `.md` file in `/blog`.
3. Push to GitHub (or wherever).
4. Profit.

---

## 🔹 Unordered List Example

- Markdown
- Coffee
- Static Sites
- 🐛 Bugs you forgot to fix

---

## 💬 Blockquote Example

> "Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication."  
> — *Leonardo da Vinci*

---

## 🧮 Inline Code Example

You can put inline code like `console.log("Hello world!")` directly in your paragraph.

---

## 🧱 Code Block (JavaScript)

```js
function greet(name) {
  return `Hello, ${name}! 👋`;
}

console.log(greet("Markdown World"));
